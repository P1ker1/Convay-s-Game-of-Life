# Convay-s-Game-of-Life
Convay's game of life made with Python/tkinter. This is by far my longest project so far, so it's not the prettiest code ever, but I'm content with the functionality

Running the code is simple. It uses only a few Python standard libraries (tkinter, random, timeit, copy). 

In order to run the code, download it, unpack and run it with your Python 3 or IDE.

Note the code was made with Python 3.7 and contains f-strings, for instance.
